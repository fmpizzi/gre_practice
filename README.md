In an ideal world this program would be unneccesary ðŸ™‰

Python code for practising for math test GRE (Generical Random Exercises) . 

This code provides random exercises on: 

**Multiplication:** Generates two random integers and asks the user to calculate their product.

**Addition:** Generates multiple random integers and asks the user to calculate their sum.

**Subtraction:** Generates two random integers and asks the user to calculate their difference.

**Division:** Generates two random integers and asks the user to provide both the quotient (integer division) and remainder.

**Prime Numbers:** Asks the user to identify the next prime number following a given prime number from a predefined list.

**Decimal Multiplication:** Generates two random decimal numbers and asks the user to calculate their product, rounded to four decimal places.

**Fraction Addition:** Generates six random integers to form three fractions and asks the user to calculate their sum, rounded to the nearest integer.

**Pythagorean Triples:** Generates a right triangle with random dimensions and asks the user to calculate the hypotenuse, rounded to two decimal places.



Each exercise type prompts the user with a mathematical question based on randomly generated parameters. The user's responses are evaluated for correctness, and statistics such as total correct answers, total incorrect answers, percentage correct, total time taken, and average time per question are calculated and stored in a CSV file for review and analysis.


**Feel free to adapt it to your own studying requirments!** :)
